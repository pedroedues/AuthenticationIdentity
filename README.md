# Authentication With Identity
Project has been developing to study Authentication using Identity and security with ASP.NET Core. It has not finished yet. I have made an simple interface with blazor - UI to register and another one to login - and the user only could see some resources if he was logged in.

I intend to study it and improve my knowledge about this tecnology.
